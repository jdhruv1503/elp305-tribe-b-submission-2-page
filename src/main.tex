\begin{abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\numberline{}Abstract}
    The design document outlines a comprehensive approach to creating a cleaning machine tailored for white unbleached\index{unbleached} cotton fabric. The fabric specifications include a new, 400- \gls{thread count}, 60-\gls{Denier} cotton fabric with a dry weight of 11 kgs to be washed in a 45-minute single cleaning cycle. The machine is designed to accommodate a maximum fabric width of 2 meters, ensuring efficiency and practicality. Environmental considerations are integrated into the design, utilizing non-toxic, biodegradable\index{biodegradable} detergents for wet cleaning, aligning with sustainability standards. The machine's structural components, such as the rotating drum and water mist-steam\index{mist-steam} cleaning module, are strategically designed to optimize the \gls{Cleaning Efficacy} while preserving fabric integrity. The machine's operational features include an integrated system for introducing wet cleaning chemicals at specific stages, ensuring precise timing to maximize effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects on fabric quality. The use of a \gls{plc} and a \gls{hmi} enhances operational control and user interaction. In terms of efficiency, the \gls{tumble drying process}\cite{deans2001modelling} is highlighted, utilizing a rotating drum \cite{lim2010dynamic} with hot air circulation. The machine structure is outlined, encompassing inner and outer components, sensors, pumps, valves, and safety features. Regular cleaning and maintenance considerations are incorporated to manage lint\index{lint} buildup and ensure long-term reliability\index{reliability}. The fabric and machine specifications are meticulously addressed, considering factors such as \gls{Tear Strength}, temperature range, flammability, power load preferences, and batch size. The design emphasizes adaptability\index{adaptability} to different cleaning methods (water, dry, air) and remains cost-effective while adhering to a maximum power load of 1-phase 220V 15A or 3-phase 440V 8A.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Motor and Conveyor belt:} 
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Total weight to be driven by motors = \SI{1500}{kg} and speed = 
\SI{0.25}{\m\per\min}, assuming coefficient of friction = 0.5, we get total pull =
$1500 \times 0.25 \times 0.5 = \SI{200}{\kg\m\per\min}$ (approximately, including margin).
\item \SI{1}{hp} = \SI{4500}{\kg\m\per\min}

    \end{enumerate}


\subsection{Cost Specifications}

   \subsubsection{Chemicals used for washing:} 
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item For efficient and cost-effective washing, we recommend Surf Excel Matic Front Load Liquid Detergent. The estimated cost for washing one cloth, including 500 ml of detergent and 300 gm of soda ash for water softening, is Rs 142. This cost-effective solution ensures high-quality cleaning performance.

\item Considering one cloth takes 500 ml of detergent.
With 5 L of detergent nearly 10-11 cotton fabric can be washed.
Cost of 500 ml Surf excel matic detergent is Rs 130
For 10 such clothes the cost requirement would be Rs 1300
\item For 1 cloth: 500 ml of liquid detergent + 300 gm of soda ash,
Rs 130 + Rs 12 = Rs 142

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Water Nozzles:} Rs 300-500 per nozzle
\subsubsection{Motor and Conveyor Belt:} 
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Cost of belt is 4500 Rs per meter(2 m wide) so total = 50,000 for 10-11 meters


\item Cost of a motor is Rs 5000

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Heating Element Cost:} Nichrome\index{Nichrome} is a cost-effective heating element compared to other alternatives like copper. The specific alloy\index{alloy} composition and manufacturing processes can influence the cost, but overall, it offers a balance between efficiency and affordability. The cost can be estimated to 1,800 per kg.


\subsubsection{Rollers Cost:} Rs 15,000 per piece. The cost may vary as we change the diameter of the roller. We would need 9 cm and 21 cm diameter. We need stainless steel rollers because they are resistant to corrosion, can be easily fabricated, and offer good mechanical properties over a wide range of temperatures. 

\subsubsection{Exhaust cost:} The exhaust costs around Rs 1800 and duct that will be made of aluminum will cost Rs 720. 

\subsubsection{Software cost:} We are using FreeCAD for \acrshort{cad} drawings and simulation so cost of software is zero.

\subsection{Performance Specifications}
   \subsubsection{Chemicals used for washing:}
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Soft or Hard Water Considerations:} To address water hardness, our design incorporates soda ash for effective water softening\index{water softening}. Estimations for soda ash usage are tailored to the water hardness levels, ensuring optimal washing performance.                  
\item \textbf{Estimation for soda ash usage:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Light Hardness (0-3 grains per gallon):} No additional soda ash may be needed for water softening.                                 
\item \textbf{Moderate Hardness (3-7 grains per gallon):} For an 11 kg load of cotton clothes, we consider using approximately 60 to 180 gm of soda ash.  
\item \textbf{Hard Water (7-10 grains per gallon or more):} In the case of hard water,  we use approximately 180 to 300 gm of soda ash for an 11 kg load of cotton clothes. Price of soda ash in market = Rs 40 per kg
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Safety Standards and Environment Guidelines:} Our washing machine design prioritizes safety and environmental sustainability. Compatibility with Surf Excel detergent is backed by rigorous safety assessments conducted by \gls{seac} under Hindustan Unilever Limited. The design complies with industry safety and quality standards, emphasizing our commitment to meeting established benchmarks.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Water Nozzles:} 
\begin{enumerate}
  
                  
\item \textbf{Nozzles for the main wash:}  For this task high-impact flat fan nozzles or tongue-type nozzles are required. The spray angle should be 30 to 45 degrees. Due to their sharp jet, tongue-type nozzles are ideally suited for low pressure. High-pressure flat fan nozzles differ from low-pressure nozzles by virtue of their hardened nozzle mouthpiece, which gives these nozzles a longer service life. Nozzles for the main wash belong to Series 688/689, they are hard, sharp flat fan, narrowly delimited jet pattern and not prone to clogging\index{clogging}.
 
 \item \textbf{Nozzles for rinsing:} Rinsing is the last stage before drying and it requires small droplets that run off the vehicle quickly. Application of flat fan nozzles with a very low flow rate in most cases is suitable. Nozzles are easy to align in conjunction with a bayonet cap\index{bayonet cap} and a ball joint\index{ball joint} along with accessories and rinsing eyelet clamps/retaining nuts.
